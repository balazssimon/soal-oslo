# soal-oslo
SOAL is a user friendly domain specific language with a familiar C#/Java-like syntax. SOAL is created to aid the automatic generation of XSD and WSDL files, and also projects for the most popular SOA development environments. SOAL also supports WS-* standards.

This SOAL implementation is based on the discontinued Microsoft Oslo metamodeling framework, but it will be ported to the MetaDslx framework.

Binary releases are published on the [SOAL web site](https://www.iit.bme.hu/~sbalazs/soal/).
