# soal-oslo
SOAL is a user friendly domain specific language with a familiar C#/Java-like syntax. SOAL is created to aid the automatic generation of XSD and WSDL files, and also projects for the most popular SOA development environments. SOAL also supports WS-* standards.

This SOAL implementation based on the deprecated Microsoft Oslo metamodeling framework, but it will be ported to the MetaDslx framework.
